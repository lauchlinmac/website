		Packed Race Weekend
	</h2>
	<p>
	With so many races geared for this weekend, many of us will be running elsewhere on Saturday.  I will still be providing routes and event page for this weekend's distances, but I will be out of town in Knoxville for my 50k, so will not be able to attend.  If you need anything for the run, please let me know and I'll look to arrange it. (email: <a href="mailto:lauchlin.macgregor@cincity.run">lauchlin.macgregor@cincity.run</a>)
	</p>
	<h2>
		Couch to 5k Program
	</h2>
	<p>
	The Couch to 5k program kicked off on Saturday, with a few friends and a stroll around the park.   We took some time to discuss our journeys to running as well as discussing important technique and training topics.   Our next meetup will be Monday, March 19 at 6:30pm at the Community Center.   We have not yet started the program (Couch to 5k by Zen Labs app for iPhone or Android), and so if you know of anyone who might be interested, let me know or have them join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/161861091143247/">Facebook Group</a>
</p>
	<h2>
		Baked Goods and other Stuff
	</h2>
	<p>
	For those interested, now that the temperature has warmed up a bit, we will start putting water and gatorade next to my Smart Car for the end of your training runs.   Since I'll be out Saturday, I'll start this on March 11.   Please feel free to bring baked goods or treats for all of us to share after the run.

	<h2>
		Hills for Track Night
	</h2>
	<p>
	This week for track, we will be instead working on some hill climbs at Pine Hill.  Running hills is a great way to improve your stride, cadence as well as strengthening your hamstrings.  From <a href="http://running.competitor.com/2016/03/training/why-hill-repeats-make-you-a-better-runner_146676" target=_blank>Competitor Running</a>,"These short bursts of effort increase muscular endurance by improving neuromuscular responsiveness," she explains. "Several muscle groups fire at once, increasing blood volume to these large muscles."   Doing hill work during your training along with stair work help balance out your training.
	</p>
	<h2>
		20/12 Runs Downtown
	</h2>
	<p>
	We will have two long runs of 20 and 12 miles, which will be done downtown.  On March 24, we will meet up at Longworth Hall to run a portion of the Flying Pig course.   Routes will be provided and I will be planning an after-run activity for the group.   On April 14, the official Flying Pig 20/12 training run will be held, which will include several of the running groups from the area.   Refreshments, music and activities will be included and more information will be provided when they are available.  As always, if anyone in the group wants to run downtown more, please feel free to post to the Facebook group so that other interested folks can join you.
	</p>
	<h2>
		20 Days of the Flying Pig
	</h2>
	<p>
	The <a href="http://flyingpigmarathon.com/">Flying Pig</a> has announced <a href="http://flyingpigmarathon.com/events/20th-anniversary-celebration/4065-2/">20 days on the run</a> which are activities leading up to the Flying Pig 20th Anniversary weekend.   I will be working on group join ups for some of these and will announce on the Facebook page once I figure them all out.   Any suggestions are encouraged and very welcome.
	</p>
	<h2>
		New Slack Server
	</h2>
	<p>
	As mentioned in the previous week's newsletter, I've set up a new slack server for the running group. (<a href="https://join.slack.com/t/cincityrun/shared_invite/enQtMzE5NzkxMzA4ODMzLWY1YjliMDk2ZDc5N2JhY2E0NzQwYjVhNTAwMDExMWZhYTE1NmJiNWJhNjEwY2I4NjllZDVkMjdkMjkyNjIwOG">Join here</a>) For those unfamiliar with Slack, it's basically a real time chat room, with different channels to post specific items.  For example, if you wanted to post one of your runs, you would join #shareyourruns channel and post from your Garmin or photo gallery.   If you had a question, you would join #askaquestion.  Or if you just felt like chatting it up, you would join #general.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, I've setup several "commands" you can type in at any time for information.   Typing "!route" will give you links to the routes for Saturday's long run.   Typing !halfplan will give you the link to the Half Training plan.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Couch25k Program
	</h2>
	<p>
	The couch to 5k program is just around the corner on March 10th.  If you're interested, come on out at 11am at the Community Center.  If you're already a part of the group and want to help coach or lead, please contact me.

		Newsletter
	</h2>
	<p>
	Obviously I've setup a new Newesletter to keep you up to date with all things happening in the Cin City Running Group.  I hope to have a weekly issue, unless news is too light to warrant it.   Feel free to find all Newsletters with the most current at the top, at <a href="http://newsletter.cincity.run/">newsletter.cincity.run</a> anytime you want.

	<h2>
		Training in Full Swing
	</h2>
	<p>
	Training for the <a href="http://flyingpigmarathon.com/">Flying Pig</a> is in full swing.   Week 9 has us running 8x800s at the track, while the long run is 9 and 16. (both of which we've done before).   As we get longer on these miles, it's important to stretch and roll before and after each run, especially the long runs.  This allows the built up lactic acid to be broken up, which helps with continuing to run injury-free.   Bring with it some strength training during your weeks - adding in some wall sits, planks, lunges or squats.  By building up your upper leg muscles, you are ensuring that you're addressing your entire leg, so that it's fully able to absorb the stress of these long runs.   The weaker your glutes or quads are, the more likely that stress is absorbed by other muscles, such as your ankles or calves.   You want to have the entire leg muscles working together to minimize the stress that's involved over such a long period of time.
	</p>
	<h2>
		New Slack Server
	</h2>
	<p>
	I've set up a new slack server for the running group. (<a href="https://join.slack.com/t/cincityrun/shared_invite/enQtMzE5NzkxMzA4ODMzLWY1YjliMDk2ZDc5N2JhY2E0NzQwYjVhNTAwMDExMWZhYTE1NmJiNWJhNjEwY2I4NjllZDVkMjdkMjkyNjIwOG">Join here</a>) The server has multiple channels for discussion on our group.   Post a photo or run summary to "#sharemyruns".   Ask a question in "#askaquestion".   Invite fellow runners to join you on an off day run in "#runinvites" or just talk about random things in "general".   I think this is a great place to share running discussion outside of our facebook group.  I will have a walkthrough on Sunday 3/4 at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Kidd-Coffee-Wine-Bar-Mason-79836266919/">Kidd Coffee</a> time TBD for anyone interested.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Couch to 5k Coming Soon
	</h2>
	<p>
	Starting March 10, the kickoff to the couch to 5k programs begins.   We will be using an app and working together to make our way to the <a href="http://parkinsoncincinnati.org/steady-strides">Parkinson's Steady Strides</a> 5k on May 19, 2018.  If you've always wanted to run, but felt you were too "out of shape" or "not a runner", this program is for you.  We will be meeting up every Sunday at the Community Center, after the kick off to assess the past week of activities and to do the activity of the day together.   We'll also be talking about techniques and mindsets that you want to have for running.  Come out and join us!
