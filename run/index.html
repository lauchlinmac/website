Welcome to Cin City Running Group.  We are a running group based out of Mason, Ohio primarily focused on long distance running, with training for half and full marathons in spring and fall seasons.  We started in January of 2018 and our 18 week training program is targeting Columbus and Detroit Half and Full Marathons. (the plan can be used for any and is available to the right via Google Calendars - as well as the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1407686512587881/">Facebook Group</a>)
